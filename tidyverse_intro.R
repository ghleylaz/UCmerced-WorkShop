## Challenge

## Challenge
## Create a new data frame from the surveys data 
## that meets the following criteria: contains only the species_id column 
## and a new column called hindfoot_half containing values that are half the hindfoot_lengthvalues. In this hindfoot_half colulues are less than 30mn, there are no NAs and all va.

## ggplot2

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x= weight, y = hindfoot_length)) + geom_point(alpha= 0.8, aes(color = species_id))

## Challenge

#Use what you just learned to create a scatter plot of weight over species_id with
#the plot types showing in different colors. Is this a good way to show this type of data?

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x= species_id, y = weight)) + geom_point(alpha= 0.8, aes(color = plot_type))


## boxplot instead of a scatter

ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = plot_type)) +
  labs(x = "species",
       y = "weight",
